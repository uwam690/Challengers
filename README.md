COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenger

This repository contains my submission for the COA TASKFORCE Take Home Challenge. 
The challenge includes building an interactive photo gallery and solving two coding challenges using JavaScript.

Interactive Photo Gallery Setup Instructions

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone<https://github.com/uwam690/Challengers.git

Navigate to the project directory: cd interactive-photo-gallery Open the animalgallery.html file in your
web browser to view the interactive photo gallery. 
open the javascript.js file to see the interactive gallery structure, location and all. Approach HTML Structure: 
I used the provided Figma designs to create the HTML structure for the photo gallery Each image is wrapped in a

element with appropriate classes for styling and interaction.
CSS Styling: I used CSS to style the gallery elements, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy with the Figma designs Media queries 
were implemented to ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes and devices

JavaScript Interactivity: JavaScript was used to implement interactivity features such as image navigation and hover interactions, 
Additional details are displayed when a user hovers over a photo, as specified in the Figma prototype.

Coding Challenges Setup Instructions Navigate to the Challenges directory: cd Challenges you Open the arrayMap.js and stringTransform.js

files in your preferred code editor to view the solutions, Approach Array Manipulation (arrayMap.js): I implemented a function to determine 
if there exists a contiguous subarray within an array that sums up to the target The solution follows the provided problem statement and constrai
achieving the expected time and space complexity

String Transformation (stringTransform.js): I implemented a function to transform a string
based on the provided rules. The solution handles all possible cases mentioned in the problem statement and achieves the expected time and space complexity
